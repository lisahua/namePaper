% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.0 May 2012
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}

 Developers often make {\it systematic edits} that are similar but not identical edits to multiple locations for bug fixes, feature editions, refactoring and new API adaptation.  It is challenging to identify all relevant locations and perform consistent changes to different contexts without introducing new bugs.  
 
  To help recommend similar systematic edits and complete code transformation automatically, we implement a tool called Clipboard to  identify all matched edit locations and perform consistent edits to all code locations. Our approach simplifies the configuration and invocation process for the code transformation via drag-and-drop.  With Clipboard, developers define the template of systematic edit  by dragging the example code region  to a virtual Clipboard before the editing and taking the snapshot again with drag-and-drop action after the editing. Developers can demonstrate one or more examples to generate an {\it edit recipe} \textendash a reusable template of complex edit operations.  
  
  
  Given an edit recipe, our tool automatically identifies all matched edit locations and applies the transformation to all code locations. Developers can also invoke Clipboard on the fly and our tool will recommend the most suitable recipe based on the incoming edit stream  against multiple edit recipes.  
    Before applying the changes to target edit locations,  Clipboard analyzes the naming patterns between related variables and recommends a reasonable name for the identifiers in the target code location. Finally, our tool  proactively checks the compilation errors, informs developers of the consequences after performing the transformation with the change previews at multiple code locations, and applies the transformation after approved by the developers.  
 
 We evaluate our tool with a test suite of 68 exemplar changed methods from Eclipse JDT and SWT. 
 
 
 % Our tool is able to    
  
%  edit locations based on the edit recipe or identify , generate reasonable variable names based on the naming patterns between related variables, and proactively check the compilation errors before applying the transformation. 

%Integrated development environments provide recommendations for a number of common edits, such as refactorings and fixes for compilation errors. However, these tools are confined with pre-defined program transformation templates with complex configuration. As the number of supported systematic edits and advanced options increases, invoking the consequence of the transformations becomes even harder and thus impedes the usage of systematic edits recommendation.  

%,  we build a new content assist Eclipse plugin, called SyditRecommender, for context sensitive systematic change recommendation and auto-completion upon user request using edit recipes learned from examples. Our approach simplifies the configuration and invocation process for the code transformation. Given one or more examples for the systematic edits, our tool first dynamically abstracts edit recipes with context information, detects incoming edit streams, recommends the most suitable transformation proposals and displays the  change preview before developers apply the transformation. SyditRecommender also provides a speculative analysis for the target programs to evaluate the consequence of applying the edit recipes. 
%direct drag-and-drop manipulation of code snippets. 
 %With Clipboard, developers can define reusable template of arbitrary edit operations by taking snapshot before and after the change with drag and drop action, preview the consequence of the edits and further apply the change by directly invoking the content assist completion engine in Eclipse or simply drag the snapshot snippet to the target piece of code. 

%Our preliminary result shows a prototype Eclipse content assist Plugin for the program transformation with edit recipes learned from examples.

% The following two commands are all you need in the

\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc,transform,clone,proactive,synthesis}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file

%%Appendix A
%\section{Headings in Appendices}
%The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
%the body of the article are different in the appendices.
%In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
%\textbf{section} is used to
%indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
%designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
%a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
%hierarchical structure
%\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
%highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
%document in Appendix-appropriate form:
%\subsection{Introduction}
%\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
%\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
%\subsubsection{Math Equations}
%\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
%\paragraph{Display Equations}
%\subsubsection{Citations}
%\subsubsection{Tables}
%\subsubsection{Figures}
%\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
%\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}

%This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
%You just add the names and information in the

%of the document.
%\subsection{References}
%Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
